OSINT Recon Toolkit

## Overview
OSINT Recon Toolkit is a powerful Python-based reconnaissance tool designed for cybersecurity researchers, ethical hackers, and information gathering professionals. This toolkit provides a range of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) capabilities to collect and analyze publicly available information about domains, IP addresses, social media profiles, and potential data breaches.

## Features
- **WHOIS Lookup**: Retrieve domain registration information
- **Shodan Scan**: Perform network/IP reconnaissance
- **DNS Lookup**: Resolve domain to IP addresses
- **Social Media OSINT**: Cross-platform username searching
- **Dark Web Monitoring**: Search for mentions across dark web sources
- **HIBP (Have I Been Pwned) Check**: Verify email breach status
